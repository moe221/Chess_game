# Chess Game
Fully functional 2-player chess

# Overview

I made this game because i like playing chess and thought it would be a perfect way for me to practice OOP and GUIs!

# How it works
Clicking on a piece will select it and clicking on a location on the board will move the selected piece to that location if the move is allowed. A player's turn is over after they have made a valid move.The game is over when a player capture's the opponent's King.
